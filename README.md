# The Shared Library

Our software connects book givers and collectors, making it easier to declutter bookshelves while giving books a second life.
It allows users to search for books by author, theme, or type, and locate the nearest sharing boxâ€”promoting free access to knowledge and culture. 
By fostering community engagement, it also lets givers discover who picks up their books and why, creating a meaningful exchange beyond the transaction.
